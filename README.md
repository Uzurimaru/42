# 42
Welcome to my coding journey at 42!

[![rwintgen's 42 stats](https://badge42.coday.fr/api/v2/clrv21dv5517501p4v0sbfuz1/stats?cursusId=21&coalitionId=219)](https://github.com/Coday-meric/badge42)
## Piscine
#### Passed in September 2023
The 42 piscine is the month-long entry exam for 42.

You can access my Piscine exercises (up to c08) [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/piscine_42). All the exercises done have passed the Moulinette and Norminette.

## Cursus

#### libft
The goal of this project is to code from scratch basic utils functions already available in libraries like stdlib.h, unistd.h and string.h for use in later projects.

__My libft passed with final grade of 125/100. Steal my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/libft).__

![ft_printf](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/assets/150167832/2bcd3af9-c5ca-41fd-b58a-935477b07ef4)
#### ft_printf
In this project, I initated myself to variadic functions by coding from scratch a function that aims to replicate the behavior of the printf function from stdio.h for later, more complex projects.

__My ft_printf passed with final grade of 100/100. Steal my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/ft_printf).__

#### get_next_line
The function get_next_line returns the first line of a file passed as a parameter. Thanks to a static variable, the function will return the next line of a file every time it is called.

__My get_next_line passed with final grade of 125/100. Steal my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/get_next_line).__

#### Born2beroot
The goal of this project is to manually partition and setup a VM running on Debian. Several services have been configured like phpmyadmin, wordpress, MariaDB, ufw...

I'm afraid you're gonna have to figure this one out by yourself. __You can steal my monitoring script [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/Born2beroot) though.__

#### FdF
The goal of FdF is to parse a 2D map of integers of variable sizes and render them in a 3D window using the MiniLibX library.

__I haven't completed this project yet, but you can steal my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/FdF).__

#### push_swap
Push_swap is a program which goal is to sort a set of random integers by ascending order in the least amount of operations as possible using 2 stacks. Completed by implementing [A. Yigit Ogun](https://github.com/ayogun)'s Turk Algorithm.

__My push_swap passed with final grade of 100/100. Steal my work [here](https://github.com/rwintgen/42/tree/main/push_swap).__
